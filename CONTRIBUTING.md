# CONTRIBUTING

We love pull requests, but for contribute you need to follow some pre requisites.

## Install dependencies

First install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) if you don't have it installed.

Run `yarn` or `npm i` to install all project dependencies.

Obs.: All commands will be shown using `yarn`, but you choose what is best for your development.

## Initial config

- Install EditorConfig plugin for your code editor to make sure it uses correct settings.
- Clone this repository.
- Follow [standard](https://standardjs.com/) js code style.

## Development

Once you have all dependencies installed, you can run `yarn start` to start storybook playground.

Choose a task from our [roadmap](#roadmap) that haven't been already done and start work with it.

All components are inside `src` folder. You need to follow our folder structure.

- Create a react component using functional components inside `src` folder and export it inside `src/index.js`
- Use Styled Components for styles.
- Once you've exported, you'll need create a storybook story inside stories folder to see your component.
- Create documentation using docz
- Create unit tests using jest
- Check our [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/S36AdAJX1B1PZhWcNVeBKNCn/Design-System?node-id=0%3A1) for styleguide
- If you want to import files from the root folder, use `~` before the desired path.

## Create documentation

All component folder have a markdown file(.md) that will be used for documentation. We use react [React Styleguidist](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist) to create a live documentation for all components.

To run styleguidist type `yarn styleguide` and check our live documentation.
